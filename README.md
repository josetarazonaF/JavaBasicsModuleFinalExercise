I want to make a system to track my university classes, teachers and students. Each Teacher has a name, and
a salary calculated by the following rules:
- For the full time teachers: base salary (attribute) multiplied by 110% of its experience years.
- For part time teachers: base salary multiplied for its active hours per week.
The university includes a list of teachers, a list of students and a list of classes. Each class has a name, an
assigned classroom, a list of students and a teacher. Every student has his name, id, and age.
